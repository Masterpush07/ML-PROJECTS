# ML Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects. Each project is organized into its own folder (e.g., `Project 1`, `Project 2`, etc.).

## Set Up 

## Google Colab 
1. **Clone the repository directly in Colab**:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/Masterpush07/ML-PROJECTS.git

2. **Navigate to a specific project folder in Colab**:
   ```python  
   %cd ML-PROJECTS/Project1

4. **Run the notebook**:

    Open the .ipynb file from the folder.
    Execute cells within Colab.


 ## VS Code
1. **Clone the repository in your local environment**:
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/Masterpush07/ML-PROJECTS.git

3. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```python
   cd ML-PROJECTS/Project1
   
5. **Open the folder in VS Code**:
   ```python
   code .

7. **jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb**
   ```python
    eg:- jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb

  ## Projects
  
   Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction
              (Predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms.)
              
   Project 2: Rock vs Mine Prediction
              (Predict whether an object is a rock or a mine using sonar signal data and machine learning techniques.)

   Project 3: Diabetes Prediction
              (Predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using clinical features and machine learning algorithms.)

   Project 4: Spam Mail Prediction
              (Classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham) using natural language processing and machine learning.)           
   
   (More projects will be added as they are completed.)
