# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using sonar data.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training machine learning models
- Model performance evaluation

## How to Use

1. **Google Colab Users**:
   - Directly upload the `2_rock_vs_mine.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
   - Most libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are pre-installed, so no additional installation is required.

2. **Other Environments**:
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy
     pip install pandas
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```
   - Run the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook 2_rock_vs_mine.ipynb
     ```

## Technologies
- Python
