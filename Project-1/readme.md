# Heart Disease Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease based on various health metrics. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training machine learning models
- Model performance evaluation

## How to Use

1. Google Colab Users:
   
   Directly upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab.
   
   Most libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are pre-installed, so no additional installation is required.

2. Other Environments:
   Install the required libraries:
   
   pip install numpy
   
   pip install pandas
   
   pip install scikit-learn


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook 1_Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
   
## Technologies
  - Python
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Logistic Regression Model
